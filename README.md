# Network-Project
## This is a project where my team and I created a network for a small business
The client requested the network be secure, with an internal Windows domain, internal Microsoft IIS Webserver, internal Windows 10 workstation, a public webserver, public FTP server, a LAN on 10.128.0.0/24, DMZ on 10.128.10.0/24, and GUEST network on 10.128.99.0/24.
We began with a pre-configured WAN-Cloud and WAN-Switch in GNS3. 

![Stage 0](https://github.com/GitRoss16/Network-Project/assets/144251501/32f89193-c0ed-4663-8261-63e1a66f9da6)


# Stage 1: Network Setup

During this stage we added 2 ethernet switches, a FortiNet firewall (FortiGate), and configured a LAN network within it. Connected a firewall graphical user interface from the WIN10 machine, and then completed the setup of the network though that firewall GUI by connecting all of these components together. Connections are as follows.

- WAN port on firewall to WAN-SWITCH
- LAN port on firewall to LAN-SWITCH
- DMZ port on firewall to DMZ-SWITCH
- WIN10 workstation to LAN-SWITCH.
  
We set up the Virtual LAN interface using CLI. Commands as follows.

- conf sys int
- edit port2
- set allowaccess ping http https ssh
- set ip 10.128.0.1/24
- end

We then verified the configuration by using the command, "show sys int port2".

We configured the DHCP server for the LAN interface. This would allow the firewall to perform DHCP services on the LAN network.

Knowing that the DHCP pool scope would be 10.128.0.100-199, we again utilized the CLI to input commands. Commands as follows.

- conf sys dhcp server
- edit 1
- set default-gateway 10.128.0.1
- set netmask 255.255.255.0
- set interface port2
- config ip-range
- edit 1
- set start-ip 10.128.0.100
- set end-ip 10.128.0.199
- next
- end
- next
- end

We then verified the configuration by using the command, "show sys dhcp server 1". 

Our next objectice was adding the WIN10 workstation

First we verified that the WIN10 had leased a DHCP address from the LAN network. Again using CLI. 

- ipconfig /all

This showed us that we had a valid IP range of 10.128.0.[100-199]/24, a gateway of 10.128.0.1, and DHCP server at 10.128.0.1.

To test their connectivity, we used a ping test for each. Commands as follows.

- For the LAN: ping 10.128.0.1
- For the WAN: ping 8.8.8.8
- For the DNS: ping google.com

These ping test's resulted in a succesful LAN connection, but was unsuccesul for the WAN and DNS.

Connecting to the firewall GUI required us to navigate to "http://10.128.0.1/", login with our credentials, and make various changes to the FortiGate set up prompt. Changes as follows.

- hostname = firewall
- timezone = -6:00 Central Time (U.S.& Canada)
- setup device as local NTP server = enabled
- list on interfaces = port2, port4
- idle timeout = 60
- autofile system check = enabled

We then saved a backup of the firewall configuration and saved it to a folder on our WIN10 machine. After saving, we rebooted the system in order to make the changes.

 The last step within stage 1 was the longest but really started connecting all the peices together.
 Per our clients request, we had to configure the following. (All of this was done on the 'http://10/128.0.1/' webserver)

 - 10.128.0.0/24 as the LAN network
 - 10.128.99.0/24 as the GUEST network
 - 10.128.10.0/24 as the DMZ network
 
 Within the Network > Interfaces tab, the following changes were made.

 ### Port1 WAN

 - role = DMZ
 - ip/network mask = 10.128.10.1/24

 To enable the DNS, we navigated to System > Feature Visibility, and made the following changes.

 - dns database = enabled
 - APPLY CHANGES
   
 To configure the firewall system DNS settings, we nevigated to Network > DNS and made the following changes.

 ### DNS 

 - dns servers = specify
 - primary dns server = 8.8.8.8
 - secondary dns server = 1.1.1.1
 - APPLY CHANGES

 Within Network > DNS Servers...

 ### LAN DNS

 - members = ALL_ICMP, NTP, RDP, SSH, WEB ACCESS, WINDOWS AD

 ### DMZ Services

 - create new > service group
 - name = DMZ-services-group

 Finally, we navigated to the Policy & Objects > IPv4 Policy tab to configure the remaining firewall rules.

 To conclude the last steps of Stage 1, we performed another backup of the firewall configuration to ensure the application of these changes were made. After this, our network topology looked a little something like 
 this.

 ![Phase11](https://github.com/GitRoss16/Network-Project/assets/144251501/a7831216-744f-42a8-be64-eb6275308899)

After this we configured a DHCP server for the LAN interface.
1. By using "conf sys dhcp server", we were able to access the DHCP Server settings and set the deafult gateway to 10.128.0.1. and the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0.
2. We assigned the interface to port2 and defined the IP range.
3. Specified the start and end IP addresses.
4. Exited the configuration.
5. Verified the DCHP server settings by using "show sys dchp sever 1" in the terminal.
   <Picture here>

   The next step was to configure the Windows 10 workstation and confirm the DCHP lease.
1. Exectued the "ipconfig /all" command in the terminal.
2. Verified that we had a valid IP range of 10.128.0.[100-199]/24, a gateway address of 10.128.0.1, and a DHCP address of 
   10.128.0.1.

   We then began to run some test's to check our network connectivity. To do this, we ran a simple "ping" command to the 
   different servers.
 1. ping 10.128.0.1 (ping to the LAN that was successful).
 2. ping 8.8.8.8 (ping to the WAN that failed).
 3. ping google.com (ping to the DNS that failed).

Using pre-configured instructions, we accessed the GUI via the Windows 10 browser to make system changes to the dashboard. 
1. Updated hostname.
2. Timezone.
3. Local NTP server was enabled.
4. Interfaces were listed.
5. Idle timeout was set.
6. Auto file system check was enabled.

   Once these changes were made, we performed a backup of the configuration and rebooted the firewall.
