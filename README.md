# Network-Project
## This is a project where my team and I created a network for a small business
The client requested the network be secure, with an internal Windows domain, internal Microsoft IIS Webserver, internal Windows 10 workstation, a public webserver, public FTP server, a LAN on 10.128.0.0/24, DMZ on 10.128.10.0/24, and GUEST network on 10.128.99.0/24.
We began with a pre-configured WAN-Cloud and WAN-Switch in GNS3. 

![Stage 0](https://github.com/GitRoss16/Network-Project/assets/144251501/32f89193-c0ed-4663-8261-63e1a66f9da6)


# Stage 1: Network Setup

During this stage we added 2 ethernet switches, a FortiNet firewall (FortiGate), and configured a LAN network within it. Connected a firewall graphical user interface from the WIN10 machine, and then completed the setup of the network though that firewall GUI by connecting all of these components together. Connections are as follows.

- WAN port on firewall to WAN-SWITCH
- LAN port on firewall to LAN-SWITCH
- DMZ port on firewall to DMZ-SWITCH
- WIN10 workstation to LAN-SWITCH.
  
We set up the Virtual LAN interface using CLI. Commands as follows.

- conf sys int
- edit port2
- set allowaccess ping http https ssh
- set ip 10.128.0.1/24
- end

We then verified the configuration by using the command, "show sys int port2".

We configured the DHCP server for the LAN interface. This would allow the firewall to perform DHCP services on the LAN network.

Knowing that the DHCP pool scope would be 10.128.0.100-199, we again utilized the CLI to input commands. Commands as follows.

- conf sys dhcp server
- edit 1
- set default-gateway 10.128.0.1
- set netmask 255.255.255.0
- set interface port2
- config ip-range
- edit 1
- set start-ip 10.128.0.100
- set end-ip 10.128.0.199
- next
- end
- next
- end

We then verified the configuration by using the command, "show sys dhcp server 1". 

Our next objectice was adding the WIN10 workstation

First we verified that the WIN10 had leased a DHCP address from the LAN network. Again using CLI. 

- ipconfig /all

This showed us that we had a valid IP range of 10.128.0.[100-199]/24, a gateway of 10.128.0.1, and DHCP server at 10.128.0.1.

To test their connectivity, we used a ping test for each. Commands as follows.

- For the LAN: ping 10.128.0.1
- For the WAN: ping 8.8.8.8
- For the DNS: ping google.com

These ping test's resulted in a succesful LAN connection, but was unsuccesul for the WAN and DNS.

Connecting to the firewall GUI required us to navigate to "http://10.128.0.1/", login with our credentials, and make various changes to the FortiGate set up prompt. Changes as follows.

- hostname = firewall
- timezone = -6:00 Central Time (U.S.& Canada)
- setup device as local NTP server = enabled
- list on interfaces = port2, port4
- idle timeout = 60
- autofile system check = enabled

We then saved a backup of the firewall configuration and saved it to a folder on our WIN10 machine. After saving, we rebooted the system in order to make the changes.

 The last step within stage 1 was the longest but really started connecting all the peices together.
 Per our clients request, we had to configure the following. (All of this was done on the 'http://10/128.0.1/' webserver)

 - 10.128.0.0/24 as the LAN network
 - 10.128.99.0/24 as the GUEST network
 - 10.128.10.0/24 as the DMZ network
 
 Within the Network > Interfaces tab, the following changes were made.

 ### Port1 WAN

 - members = ALL_ICMP, NTP, RDP, SSH, WEB ACCESS, WINDOWS AD

 ### DMZ Services

 - create new > service group
 - name = DMZ-services-group

 To conclude the last steps of Stage 1, we performed another backup of the firewall configuration to ensure the application of these changes were made. After this, our network topology looked a little something like 
 this.

![Stage2 Start](https://github.com/GitRoss16/Network-Project/assets/144251501/09189b2f-63fc-4354-8f1f-07ac9af8ea9e)

# Stage 2: Domain Setup

During this stage we added more devices and linked them up, prepared a WIN2012r2 Server for the "Actice Directory Domain Services" server role and installed it, created new AD user accounts, prepared the WIN10 from stage 1 to join the domain and joined it, and added a few other small details. 

After turning the WIN2012r2 server on, connecting it, manuevering through the license agreement, we set up a a password for the admin account and logged in. Next we had to set the static IP address in Server Manager.
To get here we followed this path. Server Manager > Local Server > Ethernet instance > Right click on eth0 > properties > Internet protocol version 4 (TCP/IPv4) > Properties > input the following..

### Setting the static IP address

- ip address: 10.128.0.10
- subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
- default gateway: 10.128.0.1
- DNS1: 127.0.0.1
- DNS2: 10.128.0.1

Using a ping test, we were able to ensure that there was network connectivity. Commands as follows

- LAN - ping 10.128.0.1
- WAN - ping 8.8.8.8
- DNS - ping google.com

From here he configured the Network Time Protocol (NTP). This would set the timezone and sync with the LAN interface IP on the firewall. The path we used as follows.

### Configuring NTP 

Right click time in bottom right of screen > select "Adjust date/time" > Select "Change date and time..." > Change time zone to UTC-6:00 Central Time (U.S. & Canada) and select OK > Select the "Internet Time" tab and select "Change Settings" > In the server box, type in 10.128.0.1 and select the "Update now" box. Ensure the text below reads successful.

### Change the hostname 

Navigate to server manager > local server > select "computer name" > and type "dc" in the Computer description box, then select the "Apply box and then the "Change..." box >   

### Installing Active Directory Domain Services 

Within server manager of the WIN2012r2, we navigated to... local server > add roles and features and began the configuration process within the wizard. Steps as follows

- For the first 2 pages, "next" was selected to default options were used
- After selecting our server from the server pool, we selected next on the third page
- Checked the box next to "Active Directory Services Domain" on server roles, and then clicked "Add Features on the pop-up screen. Then next
- Next
- Next
- And finally, select the install button

Here, the installation process would begin. Navigating to the server manager notifications tab, we were able to see the progress. This notification is indicated by a yellow caution symbol. Next steps taken were...

- Select the "Promote this server to a domain controller" link
- Select the option to "Add new forest" and then we typed in the domain name of "widgets.localdomain" that was desired by our client.
- Next was selected for the remaining pages within the wizard, thus keeping all configuration options as default.
- The wizard checked to ensure all prerequisites were met, and the the "Install" button was selected.
 
After this, the server rebooted and the objective was completed successfully.

## Creating new active directory user accounts

For this section, our objective was to create multiple user accounts, assign them their permissions, and then add them to the "domain admins" security group. Here's how...

- Within server manager, we navigated to tools > Active directory users and computers > users > right click and select new > user > filled in info > next > right click the new user and select "Add to a group..." > type 
in group name in the box and select check names to underline it > select ok
This process was repeated again for each of the new user accounts. We configured 2 accounts per user. One being a standrard user account, and one being an admin account with escalated privileges.

## Preparing the WIN10 to join the domain

We began by changing the hostname to "WIN10", then changed the primary DNS server to the IP for the domain controller, and finally set the NTP to sync with the widgets.localdomain. We used the same steps as the ones 
performed at the beginning of the stage to setup the domain.

To join the WIN10, we used an admin account to join the domain within the control panel > system and security > system > computer name, domain, and workgroup settings > change settings > under computer name tab, click change > under member of, click domain and type the domain name (ours being widgets.localdomain) and select ok > and then ok again. Then we rebooted.

We then logged in with a standard user account to verify that the changes were made to our account.

## Setting the desktop background with GPO 

Here, we set a background for the domain user accounts. Here's how...

server manager > tools > group policy manager > widgets.localdomain > domains > right click deafault domain policy > edit > user configuration > policies > admin templates > desktop > desktop wallpaper and assign name (ours was c:\windows\web\wallpaper\windows\img.0.jpg) added into the comment and wallpaper name boxes > apply > ok 

We then logged out and logged back in where we were able to verify that our wallpaper had been changed. Since ours was successful, we did not have to use "gpupdate" or "gpresult" to troubleshoot, but they can be used if problems occur.

This was the completion of Stage 2. 
 
![Stage2 End](https://github.com/GitRoss16/Network-Project/assets/144251501/a09c3701-465d-4a1d-823f-613e90f38f2a)

# Stage 3: IIS Setup

In this stage, we built an IIS webserver on the WIN2012r2 server, then joined the server to the domain. 

## Preparing the WIN2012r2 server

This process was fairly simple as it required many of the same steps as the setup for the domain controller. Our requirements were as follows...

- Give static IP of 10.128.0.80
- Set the DC as primary DNS (10.128.0.10)
- Firewall LAN IP as secondary DNS (10.128.0.1)
- Sync NTP with dc.widgets.localdomain
- Change the hostname to iis 
- Join the server to the widgets domain

## Installing the IIS role 

Using server manager, our step progression went...

- Manage
- Add roles and features
- (within the first page of the wizard) click next 
- Select role-based or feature-based installation, then next
- Select appropriate server from the server pool, then next
- On the server roles page, select Web Server (IIS), then next
- We used defaults settings for the remaining pages
- On the verificatin page, we selected "restart the destination server automatically if required"
- After confirming our selections were correct, "install" was selected.

  Once the installtion had finished, we closed out the page, and went on to verify that the webserver worked. To do this...

- Opened our browser (Internet Explorer)
- Added http://localhost/ to our trusted sites list within the browsers settings menu
- Verified that the site was up and working when navigating to the address above

## Creating a test webpage on IIS 

We needed to make a testing webpage on IIS to make sure we could access it through the browser of the WIN10 workstation

Using notepad, we created an HTML file with the following text...

- <html>
- <head> 
- <title> IIS test validation website</title>
- </head> 
- <body>
- <p> test website validation completed</p>
- </body>
- </html>

We then saved this file to our documents folder and named it "test.html", then copied the file to the "c:\inetpub\wwwroot\test.html", and test the local browser in IIS at "http://localhost/test.html".

Then, using the WIN10 WS, navigated to "http://iis.widgets.localdomain/test.html" to verify. IIS setup was a success.
